            {/* Add a picture of myself here */}
            <p>I am a graduate of NAIT's DMIT program with a focus on computer software development. While I was in school I took a liking to front-end development which is what I am continuing to practice beyond my studies. Front-End devleopment allows me to express my creativity while still being able to use my problem solving skills. On my free time outside of coding I like to stream on Twitch and workout. I currently have YouTube channels for both that I edit videos and post online.</p>
